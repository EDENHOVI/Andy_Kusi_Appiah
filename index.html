    <h2>
     Full Teaching Philosophy
    </h2>
    <p>
     Human Geography has shaped my academic and personal journey. From high
          school through to university, I was drawn to understanding the
          intricate connections between people and their environments. My
          curiosity deepened as I engaged with local communities in research,
          embracing Elinor Ostrom’s idea of local people as custodians of their
          environments. Today, I teach and research with a deep commitment to
          listening closely to the lived experiences of those I study,
          especially in the political ecology of urban domestic water access.
    </p>
    <p>
     My teaching is rooted in a student-centred, inclusive approach that
          encourages critical thinking and appreciation of human-environment
          relationships. Inspired by the exceptional educators in my life, I aim
          to create a supportive learning atmosphere where students can connect
          theory with their own experiences. I design my courses to foster
          synthesis of socio-spatial knowledge, and I strive to make the
          classroom a space where diverse perspectives are welcomed and valued.
    </p>
    <p>
     I prioritize transparent and thoughtful assessment methods. By
          providing grading rubrics, templates, and examples, I help students
          feel confident and engaged. Assignments like the reading summary
          encourage both formal academic writing and creative integration of
          personal insights. Feedback is future-oriented and affirming, helping
          students grow intellectually. I also use small group discussions and
          peer interaction to build community, promote critical dialogue, and
          identify learning challenges, allowing me to adapt lessons in real
          time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Caring is a core principle in my teaching. I work closely with
          accessibility services to ensure all students, regardless of ability,
          can participate fully. I reach out to those facing personal
          difficulties and offer flexible support when needed. Inviting guest
          speakers into the classroom brings real-world perspectives that enrich
          learning and encourage empathy. Ultimately, I strive to create a
          learning environment that is respectful, inclusive, and empowering for
          all students.
